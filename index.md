### Wordle solving algorithm

Wordle Dictionary is a C++ algorithm that scores words based on their match probability for the popular web game _Wordle_. Wordle Dictionary recieves an input in the form of a 5-letter word that it will use as basis of scoring the probability of a match of the other words. It then recieves an input in the form of 5 separate digits, which are 0 - no match, 1 - match/wrong location, and 2 - match/right location. Based on these two user inputs Wordle Dictionary would analyze each individual word and assign it a rating representing its match probability. After analyzing the user will be provided with the top 20 matching words, which can be picked and inputted again together with the coresponding indicating numbers.
