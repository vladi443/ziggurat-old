### Wordle solving algorithm

Wordle Dictionary is a C++ algorithm that scores words based on their match probability for the popular web game _Wordle_. Wordle Dictionary recieves a 5-letter input word followed by a 5-digit input number that indicates if the specific charachter is present in the mystery word. After scoring each word Wordle Dictionary displayes the top 20 words that match the given pattern. The user can choose one of these words and input it again, followed by a new 5-digit number to represent the pattern of the newly entered word.

Wordle Dictionary outputs matching words together with their definition when available, which allows the user to select the most optimal word from the list provided.

Wordle Dictionary also has a BETA option to compute the best starting word. This function calculates the times each letter is present in the list of words, and constructs words with the most common letters. This method allows for the starting word to have the highest probability of containing a matching letter.

Wordle Dictionary will be registered under the GPL2 software license and its source-code will be available soon on github.
